### Reflection
- The filtering functionality using either the `title` property or `created_date` were considered.
- Running Lighthouse accessibility regardless of ARIA-tags proved to be at 100%.
- If I had more time on this project, I would implement the following:
  - End-to-end testing for the DOM
  - An env file for extra security for API key
  - Dynamically render dropdown topics via array instead of hard-coded options
  - Enhance modularity of app with a HomeView, DetailView, Dropdown components

### Organizational Resources
