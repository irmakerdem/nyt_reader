### Introduction
NYT Reader is a news reader app of the top stories from the New York Times (NYT) ðŸ“°. It updates daily based on how frequently the API is updated so you can get REAL top stories! ðŸŽ©

![Breaking Bad gif](https://media.giphy.com/media/tFRq2uoB0glJ4XpTPd/giphy-downsized-large.gif)

- User can view top stories of the 'home' topic on page load
- User can use dropdown to choose topic of interest
- User can click article title to view a detailed page of the article including an external link to NYT

### Future Features
- URL changes based on selected topic
- Dropdown is hidden on detail view
- Page refresh functionality on detail view
- Sorting functionality to filter from most recent to oldest articles
- Enhanced styling for desktop users

### Reflection
- The filtering functionality using either the `title` property or `created_date` were considered.
- Running Lighthouse accessibility regardless of ARIA-tags proved to be at 100%.
- If I had more time on this project, I would implement the following:
  - End-to-end testing for the DOM
  - An env file for extra security for API key
  - Dynamically render dropdown topics via array instead of hard-coded options
  - Enhance modularity of app with a HomeView, DetailView, Dropdown components
